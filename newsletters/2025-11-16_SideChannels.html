    <p class="greeting">Hey there,</p>
    <p class="intro">Here's what caught my attention this week:</p>
    
    <div class="featured-article">
        <h2 class="featured-title">The Camera Protects Us From What We're Looking At</a></h2>
        <p>Susan Sontag wrote in 1977 that photographing means "putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge - and, therefore, like power." She nailed it. The camera creates psychological distance. It becomes a shield between you and what's happening in front of you.</p>
        
        <p>The person holding the camera is never really in the moment they're capturing. They're framing it, adjusting exposure, thinking about composition. They're there, but they're also not there. The camera gives you permission to look without engaging, to witness without participating, to collect experiences instead of having them.</p>
        
        <p>I've culled 90,000 photos down to just the best and organized everything by camera type, date, location. On the surface this looks like preserving memories. But I'm building an archive of moments I didn't fully experience because I was too busy trying to capture them.</p>
        
        <p>Last year I went through every photo from Flynn's first five years. Thousands of images with beautiful light and perfect composition. I realized I remember the photos better than I remember the moments. The image became the memory. The memory of being there - really being there - faded.</p>
        
        <p>We've all seen it. People experiencing concerts through phone screens. Entire vacations documented in real-time for Instagram. The birthday party where everyone's photographing the cake instead of eating it. "Pics or it didn't happen" started as a joke - now it's just how things work.</p>
        
        <p>Sontag saw this coming fifty years ago. She wrote about tourism becoming primarily about image collection. The feedback loop is complete - we go places specifically to photograph them, we pose our lives for documentation, we curate experiences based on how they'll look in our camera roll. The camera doesn't just record reality anymore. It shapes what we choose to do.</p>
        
        <p>The moments you remember most vividly are usually the ones you didn't photograph. The conversations that went deep at 2am. The random Tuesday when your kid had a breakthrough and you just sat there in it. The meal that was so good you forgot your phone existed.</p>
        
        <p>When you pick up a camera you're making a choice. You're choosing documentation over participation. You're choosing to organize experience rather than be dissolved by it. You're choosing the comfort of having proof over the discomfort of just being in it.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not going to stop taking photos. I love the technical challenge. But I'm done pretending the camera doesn't change what I'm doing. When I pick up the camera I'm choosing to document instead of experience. Sometimes that's the right choice. Sometimes it's not. The trick is knowing the difference.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">blog.banast.as</p>
            <p class="article-summary">A 365-page deposition transcript dropped this week with real evidence behind last November's OpenAI board chaos. Ilya Sutskever wrote a 52-page memo calling for Sam Altman's termination, waited a year for the right board composition, and based almost everything on secondhand info from Mira Murati. The board couldn't even show up to meetings physically, expected employees not to care about the firing, and Helen Toner coordinated a call about merging with Anthropic during the chaotic weekend. Discovery is one hell of a thing.</p>

            <p class="article-summary">Landlords are using AI to digitally renovate apartment listings before they post them - removing grime, adding furniture that doesn't exist, and brightening windowless rooms. The gap between what you see online and what you walk into is about to get so wide that in-person showings are gonna feel like getting catfished.</p>

            <p class="article-summary">Big tech companies are now generating the same $100B in revenue with a fraction of the headcount they needed a decade ago - Apple went from 60k employees to 17k for their most recent $100B quarter, and Alphabet's down to 11k. The automation everyone keeps saying is "coming" has already been running these companies for years, which explains why none of them are freaking out about cutting staff anymore.</p>
