# The Camera Protects Us From What We're Looking At

I've been thinking about something Susan Sontag wrote in 1977: "To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge—and, therefore, like power."

She's talking about how the camera creates distance. Not physical distance—you can be right up in someone's face with a lens. But psychological distance. The camera becomes a shield between you and what's actually happening in front of you.

The person holding the camera is never really *in* the moment they're capturing.

They're framing it. Adjusting exposure. Thinking about composition. Watching it through a screen or viewfinder. They're there, but they're also not there.

The camera gives you permission to look without engaging. To witness without participating. To collect experiences instead of having them.

## The Organizing Obsession

I've written before about my [photography workflow](https://blog.banast.as/posts/2025-02-10-photo-workflow-2025). How I culled 90,000 photos down to just the best. How I meticulously organize everything by camera type, date, location. How I backup to NAS and cloud storage.

On the surface, this looks like someone who values their photos. Someone preserving memories.

But what am I actually doing?

I'm building an archive of moments I didn't fully experience because I was too busy trying to capture them.

Last year I went through every photo from Flynn's first five years. Thousands of images. Beautiful light. Perfect composition. Him laughing, playing, discovering the world.

And I realized: I remember the photos better than I remember the actual moments.

The image became the memory. The memory of being there—really being there—faded.

## When the Shield Becomes the Point

We've all seen it. People experiencing concerts through phone screens held at arm's length. Entire vacations documented in real-time for Instagram. The birthday party where everyone's photographing the cake instead of eating it.

"Pics or it didn't happen" started as a joke. Now it's just how things work.

Sontag saw this coming fifty years ago. She wrote about tourism becoming primarily about image collection. About how unphotographed experiences feel illegitimate, less real, less memorable.

The feedback loop is complete now: we go places specifically to photograph them. We pose our lives for documentation. We curate experiences based on how they'll look in our camera roll.

The camera doesn't just record reality anymore. It shapes what we choose to do.

## What You Lose

Here's what nobody talks about: the moments you remember most vividly are usually the ones you didn't photograph.

The conversations that went deep at 2am. The random Tuesday when something clicked with your kid and you just sat there in it. The meal that was so good you forgot your phone existed.

You remember these *because* you were fully present. Because there was no screen between you and what was happening.

The camera, for all its power to preserve, actually erases. It replaces embodied memory with visual record. And visual records are easy to scroll past, easy to forget, easy to lose in the archive of 90,000 other images that all kind of blur together.

Sontag called photographs "melancholy objects." Every photo is evidence of time passing, of loss, of absence. Even happy photos carry the shadow of "this moment is gone."

That melancholy isn't in the subject. It's in the act of photographing itself.

## The Trade-Off Nobody Admits

When you pick up a camera, you're making a choice. You might not think of it as a choice—it feels automatic now, reflexive—but it is.

You're choosing documentation over participation.

You're choosing to organize experience rather than be dissolved by it.

You're choosing the comfort of having something to show for the moment over the discomfort of just being in it.

Sometimes that's the right choice. Sometimes you want the record. Sometimes the composition is worth it. Sometimes you need the distance.

But it costs something.

It costs presence. Immediacy. The texture of actually being somewhere without an agenda.

## "Pics or It Didn't Happen" Works Both Ways

The thing about building a culture around constant documentation is that the undocumented becomes invisible.

If you don't photograph it, did you really experience it? If there's no evidence, does it count?

This is backwards.

The experiences that shaped you most—the ones that actually changed something—probably weren't photographed. They were too raw, too immediate, too personal. You were too busy living them to think about capturing them.

The camera protects you from that rawness. From intensity. From the vulnerability of just being somewhere without purpose or product.

And we've built an entire world around this protection.

## What I'm Learning

I'm not going to stop taking photos. I love the technical challenge. I love the aesthetic problem-solving. But I'm done pretending the camera doesn't change what I'm doing.

When I pick up the camera, I'm making a choice: I'm choosing to document instead of experience. To frame instead to feel. To collect instead of participate.

Sometimes that's the right choice. Sometimes it's not.

The trick is knowing the difference.
