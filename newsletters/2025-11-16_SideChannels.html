    <p class="greeting">Hey there,</p>
    <p class="intro">Here's what caught my attention this week:</p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Articles Worth Your Time</h2>

        <div class="article">
            <h3 class="article-title">
                <a href="https://blog.banast.as/posts/2025-11-15_camera-protects-us" target="_blank">The Camera Protects Us From What We're Looking At</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">blog.banast.as</p>
            <p class="article-summary">Susan Sontag wrote that the camera creates psychological distance - a shield between you and what's happening in front of you. The person holding the camera is never really in the moment they're capturing. They're framing it, adjusting exposure, thinking about composition. Last year I went through every photo from Flynn's first five years and realized I remember the photos better than I remember the moments. The image became the memory. The memory of being there - really being there - faded. When you pick up a camera you're choosing documentation over participation, choosing to organize experience rather than be dissolved by it. Sometimes that's the right choice. Sometimes it's not. The trick is knowing the difference.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">blog.banast.as</p>
            <p class="article-summary">A 365-page deposition transcript dropped this week with real evidence behind last November's OpenAI board chaos. Ilya Sutskever wrote a 52-page memo calling for Sam Altman's termination, waited a year for the right board composition, and based almost everything on secondhand info from Mira Murati. The board couldn't even show up to meetings physically, expected employees not to care about the firing, and Helen Toner coordinated a call about merging with Anthropic during the chaotic weekend. Discovery is one hell of a thing.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">futurism.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">Landlords are using AI to digitally renovate apartment listings before they post them - removing grime, adding furniture that doesn't exist, and brightening windowless rooms. The gap between what you see online and what you walk into is about to get so wide that in-person showings are gonna feel like getting catfished.</p>

            <p class="article-source">futurism.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">Companies are using AI adoption as cover for layoffs while seeing zero revenue growth from it - basically just cutting headcount and dumping the work on whoever's left. The data shows it's not about replacement or efficiency, it's about making cuts look like innovation instead of desperation.</p>

            <p class="article-source">mbi-deepdives.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">Big tech companies are now generating the same $100B in revenue with a fraction of the headcount they needed a decade ago - Apple went from 60k employees to 17k for their most recent $100B quarter, and Alphabet's down to 11k. The automation everyone keeps saying is "coming" has already been running these companies for years, which explains why none of them are freaking out about cutting staff anymore.</p>

He's either about to be wrong twice in a row or these companies are about to get absolutely hammered when the market corrects.</p>
