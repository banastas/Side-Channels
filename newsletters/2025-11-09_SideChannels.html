            <a href="https://blog.banast.as/2025-11-13_Simplex-Optimization" target="_blank">Why the Simplex Method Actually Works</a>
        </h2>
        <p class="article-source">blog.banast.as</p>
        <p>Researchers just cracked why one of the most important problem-solving tools does what it does.</p>
        
        <p>The simplex method is an algorithm invented in 1947 that companies, scientists, and governments use every day to solve optimization problems. How to route deliveries, balance budgets, design networks, allocate resources efficiently. In theory, simplex can behave badly and take exponential time to complete. In practice, it's incredibly fast. That disconnect has puzzled mathematicians for decades.</p>
        
        <p>Sophie Huiberts and Eleon Bach just tightened the theory. They analyzed simplex under a realistic assumption - that real-world data is never perfectly clean and always has a bit of randomness or noise. With that lens, they showed two things: First, simplex is even more efficient than earlier analyses suggested. Second, within that realistic model, you can't get a better guarantee using this type of method. They found the optimal explanation for its performance.</p>
        
        <p>This doesn't make simplex magically faster overnight. It does more - it narrows the gap between what the math predicts and what people observe in practice.</p>
        
        <p>George Dantzig invented simplex while working as a mathematical adviser to the newly formed U.S. Air Force. The military needed to solve optimization problems at scale - how to strategically allocate limited resources when dealing with hundreds or thousands of variables. Nearly 80 years later, the simplex method is still among the most widely used tools when a logistical or supply-chain decision needs to be made under complex constraints.</p>
        
        <p>The simplex method quietly powers much of modern logistics, economics, and operations research. It's been running fast for almost 80 years, but the theory couldn't explain why. This work doesn't make simplex faster - it strengthens confidence in an algorithm that's already embedded in systems worldwide. The math now matches what practitioners have observed all along.</p>

            <p class="article-source">blog.banast.as</p>
            <p class="article-summary">A 365-page deposition transcript dropped this week with real evidence behind last November's OpenAI board chaos. Ilya Sutskever wrote a 52-page memo calling for Sam Altman's termination, waited a year for the right board composition, and based almost everything on secondhand info from Mira Murati. The board couldn't even show up to meetings physically, expected employees not to care about the firing, and Helen Toner coordinated a call about merging with Anthropic during the chaotic weekend. Discovery is one hell of a thing.</p>

The automation everyone keeps saying is "coming" has already been running these companies for years, which explains why none of them are freaking out about cutting staff anymore.</p>
