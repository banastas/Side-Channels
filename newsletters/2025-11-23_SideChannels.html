    <p class="greeting">Hey there,</p>
    <p class="intro">Here's what caught my attention this week:</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="article-source">blog.banast.as</p>

        <p>I just watched a newly released 1996 interview with Steve Jobs about building Pixar. Right after Toy Story came out. After 10 years of losing $50 million on Ed Catmull's dream of making the first computer-animated feature film.</p>

        <p>The most important lesson: "No amount of technology can turn a bad story into a good story." That became Pixar's mantra. Coming from the guy who revolutionized personal computing, that's a hell of a statement.</p>

        <p>But here's what hit hardest. Jobs talked about the difference between technology and stories. Apple IIs are gone. Macs might not boot up in five years. Disney made Snow White in 1937. Sixty years later they sold 28 million copies on video and made a quarter billion in profit. His son watched it 30 or 40 times.</p>

        <p>"People are going to be watching Toy Story in 60 years. Not because of the computer graphics, but because of the story about friendship."</p>

        <p>Software has a shelf life measured in years. Stories have a shelf life measured in generations. That's why he switched from tech to content.</p>

        <p>Pixar's magic formula: art, technology, business. Need all three. Most people quit way before ten years. Jobs didn't quit and was smart enough to know what he didn't know and hire people who did.</p>

        <p>Ten years. Fifty million dollars. One dream.</p>

            <p class="article-source">deadline.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">Nolan shot two million feet of film over 91 days at sea and put his cast on real waves for The Odyssey instead of faking it in a tank or with VFX. Shows why his stuff feels different than everyone else who would've just built it on a soundstage and saved themselves the headache.</p>

            <p class="article-summary">Astronomers found an interstellar object with 12 separate anomalies that don't match anything we've seen before - weird trajectory, strange composition, and it's accelerating in ways that make zero sense with current models. Not saying it's aliens, but they basically have no explanation for what this thing actually is or where it came from.</p>

            <p class="article-summary">Google's Gemini 3 just hit the top of the leaderboards, and the back-and-forth with XAI is actually pushing real capability improvements instead of just PR bullshit. When you've got two teams trying to one-up each other every few weeks, that's when the models actually get better at stuff people need them to do.</p>
