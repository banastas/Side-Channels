    <p class="greeting">Hey there,</p>

    <div class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">From the Archive</h2>
    <div class="article" style="border-left: 4px solid #3b82f6;">
        <h3 class="article-title" style="font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 16px;">The Test</h3>
        <div class="article-summary" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Second week of my VFX internship at Centropolis, I almost torched my entire career because some executive thought he was funny.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">I'd just convinced my boss to let me sit in shot reviews with the director and Universal's VFX head. Big deal for an intern - the last one got banned for running their mouth about shots in front of clients. My boss was clear: "you are welcome to attend, but keep your fucking mouth shut."</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Between the screening room and the compositor's office, Universal's VFX guy stepped out for a call, but really, he wanted to flirt with the receptionist. My boss sent me to find him.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">When I did, he told me to go back and deliver this message: "XX told me to say he doesn't give a fuck about this film and he's put me in charge of approvals moving forward."</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">I walked back into that room with about 3 seconds to make a choice.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Would this get a laugh? Maybe. Would the only person laughing be the guy who set me up? Probably. Did I work for him? No. I worked for my boss. Was I about to risk my entire internship for this asshole's amusement? Absolutely not.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The guy came back in, called me a chickenshit, and the review continued.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Here's what I learned that day: Your loyalty is to the person who hired you and believes in you, not to whoever wants to use you for a joke at your own expense.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">People will test you. Sometimes it's intentional, sometimes they're just being assholes. Either way, the test is the same - can you think for yourself under pressure?</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The hierarchy matters less than the relationship. I didn't report to Universal - I reported to my boss who stuck his neck out for me.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">That internship changed my life. That moment taught me how to keep it.</p>

<p class="intro">Here's what caught my attention this week:</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Articles Worth Your Time</h2>

        <div class="article">
            <h3 class="article-title">
                <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/lionsgate-movies-ai" target="_blank">Lionsgate&#039;s Attempt to Create Movies Using AI Has Crumbled Into Disaster</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">futurism.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">Lionsgate's AI movie thing tanked because they tried to replace actual creative work with tech and it shows - classic case of selling something they couldn't deliver on. Reminds me of every project where execs think the tool does the work instead of the people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            <h3 class="article-title">
                <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/video-aheadform-robot-realistic-facial-expressions" target="_blank">Alarming New Video Shows Robot Making Incredibly Realistic Facial Expressions</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">futurism.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">This robot from Aheadform has facial expressions that are legitimately unsettling because they're so close to human - the kind of thing that's gonna freak people out in customer service demos. Internal teams at companies rolling out AI interfaces need to start prepping for the backlash when customers see this stuff and immediately want to talk to a real person instead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            <h3 class="article-title">
                <a href="https://futurism.com/openai-mistake-hallucinations" target="_blank">OpenAI Realizes It Made a Terrible Mistake</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="article-source">futurism.com</p>
            <p class="article-summary">OpenAI had to walk back some claims about their hallucination detection after getting called out, which shows they're scrambling to control the narrative on accuracy issues they clearly didn't think through. It's less about the mistake itself and more about how it reveals they're reacting to public pressure instead of getting ahead of it internally.</p>
