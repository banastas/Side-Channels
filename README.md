# Side Channels

Weekly newsletter exploring AI automation, creative production, and hard-earned industry lessons. Curated articles, original photography, and stories from 20+ years in the trenches of VFX and digital production.

The stuff worth paying attention to before it becomes industry consensus.

## What This Is

Side Channels is my weekly filter for signal vs. noise. Three articles that cut through the bullshit, a photo that caught my eye, and one insight from the production trenches. No filler, no fluff.

Think of it as the tab you keep open all week - the one with links worth sending to colleagues who actually get it.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Articles Worth Your Time**: Three pieces per week on AI, automation, and creative tech that either change how you think about something or confirm you weren't crazy for thinking it
- **Photo of the Week**: Original photography - one shot that tells a story better than I could explain it
- **Insight of the Week**: Production wisdom from someone who's been in enough status meetings to know which patterns repeat
- **From the Archive**: Occasional stories from 20+ years in VFX and digital production - the lessons that stuck

## Why Subscribe

Because your inbox doesn't need another 2000-word thinkpiece written by someone who's never shipped a project. This is from the perspective of someone who's been on calls where "can you just make it pop?" was considered actionable feedback.

If you're sick of newsletters that waste your time, this might be worth a look.
