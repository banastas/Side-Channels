Weekly newsletter exploring AI automation, creative production, and hard-earned industry lessons. Curated articles, original photography, and stories from 20+ years in the trenches of VFX and digital production.

The stuff worth paying attention to before it becomes industry consensus.

## What This Is

Side Channels is my weekly filter for signal vs. noise. Three articles that cut through the bullshit, a photo that caught my eye, and one insight from the production trenches. No filler, no fluff.

Think of it as the tab you keep open all week - the one with links worth sending to colleagues who actually get it.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Articles Worth Your Time**: Three pieces per week on AI, automation, and creative tech that either change how you think about something or confirm you weren't crazy for thinking it
- **Photo of the Week**: Original photography - one shot that tells a story better than I could explain it
- **Insight of the Week**: Production wisdom from someone who's been in enough status meetings to know which patterns repeat
- **From the Archive**: Occasional stories from 20+ years in VFX and digital production - the lessons that stuck
