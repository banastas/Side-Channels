# Side Channels

Weekly dispatch on AI, automation, creative production, and the messy bits in between. The stuff worth paying attention to before it becomes industry consensus.

## What This Is

Side Channels is my weekly filter for signal vs. noise. Three articles that cut through the bullshit, a photo that caught my eye, and one insight from the production trenches. No filler, no fluff.

Think of it as the tab you keep open all week - the one with links worth sending to colleagues who actually get it.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Articles Worth Your Time**: Three pieces per week that either change how you think about something or confirm you weren't crazy for thinking it in the first place
- **Photo of the Week**: One shot that tells a story better than I could explain it
- **Insight of the Week**: Production wisdom from someone who's been in enough status meetings to know which patterns repeat

Topics tend to orbit around:
- AI (the practical stuff, not the hype)
- Automation (especially where it saves you from doing the same thing 40 times)
- Creative production (lessons from the front lines)
- Photography (when the light does something interesting)
